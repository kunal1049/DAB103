We have uploaded our project code here.
We have cleaned the data by using the following:-

Changing the datatype of several columns
Converting the "-" symbol from the rows to NAN values using the numpy package.
Changed the column names.
Converted the decimal point values to interger value by multiplying by 10.
We have created the data visualization for the questions that we have found from our dataset in project 1.
The questions are as follows:-

Does education level affect employment ?
Does people born in Canada have higher preferences in jobs with respect to immigrants?
As the immigration duration increases, does the jobs and education also increase?
Do both the genders have equal education?
Postsecondary certificate, university degree, and Bachelorâ€™s degree, which one is most preferable considering Employment?
Do both the genders are equally employed/unemployed or do females work more part-time than males?
